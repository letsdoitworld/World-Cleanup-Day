# Getting started

This document will help you set up the project for development.

## Basic dependencies
Install git, docker, docker-compose, node and yarn.


## Backend services
Consult the dedicated [readme](devops/dev/README.md) to set them up, run
them and verify they work.

### Adding dummy data
This repository comes without trashpoint data. You will need some to work
on the related APIS or marker related functionality.

**TODO:** expand with wcd_dummy instructions


## Web-app (admin backend)
Consult the dedicated [readme](web-app/README.md), but in essence:

```bash
npm install # the first time
npm start
```

## Mobile-apps
Consult the dedicated [readme](mobile-app/README.md).
