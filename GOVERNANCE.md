# World Cleanup Project Governance

## Core Technical Committee

The World Cleanup project is governed by a Core Technical Committee (CTC) which is responsible for high-level guidance of the project.

The CTC has final authority over this project including:

* Technical direction
* Project governance and process (including this policy)
* Contribution policy
* GitHub repository hosting
* Conduct guidelines
* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators

For the current list of CTC members, see the project [README.md](https://github.com/letsdoitworld/World-Cleanup/blob/master/Readme.md).

## Contributors

World Cleanup is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into World Cleanup. See the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/letsdoitworld/World-Cleanup-Day/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Collaborators

The GitHub repository is maintained by the CTC and additional Collaborators who are added by the CTC on an ongoing basis.

Individuals identified by the CTC as making significant and valuable contributions are made Collaborators and given commit access to the project.

_Note:_ If you make a significant contribution and are not considered for commit access, log an issue or contact a CTC member directly.

Modifications of the contents of the World Cleanup repository are made on a collaborative basis. Anybody with a GitHub account may propose a modification via pull request and it will be considered by the project Collaborators. All pull requests must be reviewed and accepted by a Collaborator with sufficient expertise who is able to take full responsibility for the change. In the case of pull requests proposed by an existing Collaborator, an additional Collaborator is required for sign-off.

If one or more Collaborators oppose a proposed change, then the change can not be accepted unless:

* Discussions and/or additional changes result in no Collaborators objecting to the change. Previously-objecting Collaborators do not necessarily have to sign-off on the change, but they should not be opposed to it.
* The change is escalated to the CTC and the CTC votes to approve the change. This should be used only after other options (especially discussion among the disagreeing Collaborators) have been exhausted.

Collaborators may opt to elevate significant or controversial modifications to the CTC by assigning the `ctc-review` label to a pull request or issue. The CTC should serve as the final arbiter where required.

For the current list of Collaborators, see the project [README.md](https://github.com/letsdoitworld/World-Cleanup-Day/blob/master/Readme.md).

A guide for Collaborators is maintained in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/letsdoitworld/World-Cleanup-Day/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Collaborator Activities

Typical activities of a Collaborator include:

* helping users and novice contributors
* contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project
* reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests
* participation in working groups
* merging pull requests

While the above are typical things done by Collaborators, there are no required activities to retain Collaborator status. There is currently no process by which inactive Collaborators are removed from the project.


### CTC Activities

Typical activities of a CTC member include:

* attending the weekly meeting
* commenting on the weekly CTC meeting issue and issues labeled `ctc-review`
* participating in CTC email threads
* volunteering for tasks that arise from CTC meetings and related discussions
* other activities (beyond those typical of Collaborators) that facilitate the smooth day-to-day operation of the LDIR project

Note that CTC members are also Collaborators and therefore typically perform Collaborator activities as well.

### CTC Meetings

The CTC meets weekly in a voice conference call. The meeting is run by a designated meeting chair approved by the CTC. 

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be reviewed by the CTC by logging a GitHub issue. 

The meeting chair is responsible for ensuring that minutes are taken and that a pull request with the minutes is submitted after the meeting.

 The process in the issue tracker is:

* A CTC member opens an issue explaining the proposal/issue and @-mentions @ldir/ctc.
* After 72 hours, if there are two or more `LGTM`s from other CTC members and no explicit opposition from other CTC members, then the proposal is approved.
* If there are any CTC members objecting, then a conversation ensues until either the proposal is dropped or the objecting members are persuaded. If there is an extended impasse, a motion for a vote may be made.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The CTC follows a [Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making) decision making model.
